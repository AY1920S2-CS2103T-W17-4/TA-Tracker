== Introduction

Are you a Teaching Assistant at School of Computing who is tired of having to keep
track of all your claimable hours in some unappealing excel spreadsheet just so you
can fill up the TSS Claims form accurately at the end of the semester? Do you want
a place where you can keep track of things related to your teaching duties, such as
keeping a track of your strongest and weakest students? If so, TA-Tracker is the tool
for you!

TA-Tracker is a productivity tool made for NUS Computing Teaching Assistants (TAs)
who want to be able to track and manage their students and claimable
hours in one place.

TA-Tracker is tailored towards TAs who *prefer to use a desktop application to
manage their teaching duties* and is well suited for those who *prefer to work with a Command
Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI).If you're interested, jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `tatracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TA tracker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Refer to <<Usage>> for details of each command.

NOTE: TA-Tracker data is saved periodically so you don't have to worry about saving
your data manually.

[[Layout]]
== Layout
This is a brief overview of the layout of the TA-Tracker. The TA-Tracker is divided
into three different views - the Student View, the Session View and the Claims View.

=== Student View
Under the students tab, the Student View is used to show you the students that you're teaching. The students
have been grouped according to module and group. The Student View has been divided into
three sections.

The first section shows a list of all the modules that you are a teaching
assistant for.

The second section shows a list of all groups in a module of your choice.
If you haven't chosen anything, by default you will be shown the groups of the module
in the first index in the list of modules.

The third section shows a list of all students in the group of your choice. If you
haven't chosen anything, by default you will be shown the students of the group in the
first index in the list of groups.

The purpose of the student view is to allow you to keep track of your students. It will
show you information such as student name, matriculation number, ratings you have given
the student and contact details such as email and telegram id.

=== Session View
Under the sessions tab, the Session View contains a list of the upcoming tasks you have.

=== Claims View
Under the claims tab, the Claim View contains a list of all the claimable duties you
have completed so far.

The purpose of this view is to allow a you to keep track of all your claims so
you can easily enter it into the TSS claims form at the end of the semester.
