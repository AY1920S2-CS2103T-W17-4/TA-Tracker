== Introduction

Are you a Teaching Assistant at School of Computing who is tired of having to keep
track of all your claimable hours in some unappealing excel spreadsheet just so you
can fill up the TSS Claims form accurately at the end of the semester? Do you want
a place where you can keep track of things related to your teaching duties, such as
keeping a track of your strongest and weakest students, all in one place? If so,
TA-Tracker is the tool for you!

TA-Tracker is a productivity tool made for NUS Computing Teaching Assistants (TAs)
who want to be able to track and manage their students and claimable
hours in one place.

TA-Tracker is tailored towards TAs who *prefer to use a desktop application to
manage their teaching duties* and is well suited for those who *prefer to work with a Command
Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI).If you're interested, jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

This section gives you a step-by-step explanation on how you can download and open
the application.

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `tatracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TA tracker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
This is what the GUI looks like when the TA-Tracker is opened for the first time.
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Refer to <<Usage>> for details of each command.

NOTE: TA-Tracker data is saved periodically so you don't have to worry about saving
your data manually.

== About the User Guide
This User Guide introduces you to TA-Tracker's features and shows you how you can use
the TA-Tracker to make your life as a Teaching Assistant easier.

=== Commonly Used Symbols:
This section shows you the symbols commonly used in the User Guide.

[NOTE]
====
This symbol indicates that there is something that you should take note of.
====

[TIP]
====
This symbol indicates that a tip is being mentioned.

=== Command Format

All the commands written in the user guide follow some rules that have been mentioned
below. This will help you better understand how to use the commands.

====
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user .
For example, in `student add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `student add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
For example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Fast learner` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
For example, `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend` (i.e. once) or
`t/friend t/family` (i.e. multiple times).
* Parameters can be in any order.
For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

[[Layout]]
== Layout
This is a brief overview of the layout of the TA-Tracker. The TA-Tracker is divided
into three different views - the *Student View*, the *Session View* and the *Claims View*.

=== Student View
Under the students tab, the Student View is used to show you the students that you're teaching. The students
have been grouped according to the *module* and *group* they belong to. The Student View has been divided into
three sections.

The first section shows you a list of all the modules that you are a teaching
assistant for.

The second section shows you a list of all groups in a module of your choice.
If you haven't chosen anything, by default you will be shown the groups of the module
in the first index in the list of modules.

The third section shows you a list of all students in the group of your choice. If you
haven't chosen anything, by default you will be shown the students of the group in the
first index in the list of groups.

The purpose of the student view is to help you keep track a of your students. It will
show you information such as student name, matriculation number, ratings you have given
the student and contact details such as email and telegram id.

=== Session View
Under the sessions tab, the Session View contains a list of the upcoming sessions
that you haven't done yet.

The sessions are automatically sorted by date.

=== Claims View
Under the claims tab, the Claim View contains a list of all the claimable duties you
have completed so far.

The purpose of this view is to allow a you to keep track of all your claims so
you can easily enter it into the TSS claims form at the end of the semester.

[[Usage]]
== Usage

You can only use this command to change the name of the module. Module code can't
be changed. Editing a module doesn't affect the students and groups inside the module.

When a module is edited, the Student View will show the groups of the module and
the students of the first group of the module.

Format: `module edit m/MOD_CODE n/NEW NAME`

[NOTE]
====
* You cannot edit a module that doesn't exist.

and module.

You can filter the students in Student View in the following ways:

****
1. module code and group code `m/` `g/`
2. module code `m/`
****

Using both module code and group code will show you the students
inside the group with the given group code of the module specified
by the module code.

Format: `student filter [m/MOD_CODE] g/GROUP_CODE`

====
Examples:

* `student filter m/cs2103t g/g06`
