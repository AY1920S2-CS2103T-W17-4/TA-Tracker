== Introduction

TA-Tracker is a productivity tool made for NUS Computing Teaching Assistants (TAs)
who want to be able to track and manage their students and claimable
hours in one place.

Teaching Assistants at SoC have to keep a track of:

* students
* students' participation marks
* notes they have for certain students that they can later use for recommendations.
* claimable hours so that they can fill up the TSS Claims form at the end of each semester.

Rather than managing this through several excel
spreadsheets and notes, TA-Tracker allows TAs to track everything in a single, convenient-to-use
platform.

In particular, TA-Tracker is a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* application packaged
with a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. This means that users are expected to interact
with the TA-Tracker mainly through the command line, but each command executed will
evoke a visual response in the TA-Tracker.

Any help on the development of the TA-Tracker would be greatly appreciated, and there
are a couple of ways that you can do so:

* contribute to TA-Tracker's code base by expanding its features
** such as adding an option to enter assignment grades
* help us improve test coverage
* propose and implement improvements on current features

This guide aims to kick-start your journey as a contributor to the TA-Tracker by getting
you up to speed with how TA-Tracker's codebase and inner workings function. It also
hopes to serve as a useful reference to current contributors in times of confusion or
when faced with difficulties.

== Setting up

You can refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

TA-Tracker has been designed with `Object-Oriented Programming`
principles in mind. We also attempted to use `Defensive Programming` wherever
possible. This section serves to give a description of the
major components in the architecture of TA-Tracker. Subsequent sections
provide more information on the inner workings of individual components.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface
and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Simplified Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other
for the scenario where the user issues the command `session delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `session delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component of `TA-Tracker`:

* processes user inputs into different `Command` objects,
* executes these `Command` objects to interact with the `Model` component, and
* saves data in the `Storage` component.

==== Logic Structure
The following diagram shows a simplified view of the structure of the Logic component .

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram1.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

In Figure 5., you can see that:

. `Logic` behaves as a Façade class between the different `TA-Tracker` components.
. `LogicManager` is the main driver class behind the logic in `TA-Tracker`
. `LogicManager` interacts with classes in the `Model` and `Storage` component.
. `TA-Tracker` logic is organised into *commands* and *parsers*.
. `TaTrackerParser` is the *main parser*.
. A `Command` can interact with classes in the `Model` component.

==== Logic Hierarchy

The following diagram shows how the *commands* and *parsers* are organised.

.Structure of commands and the hierarchy of parsers
image::LogicClassDiagram2.png[]

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* `X` is the category name for a group of commands +
(e.g. `Student`, `Session`, `Module`).
* `XY` is the category name for actions specific to a group of commands +
(e.g. `AddStudent`, `EditSession`, `DeleteModule`).
====

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* `Prefixes` contains some `Prefix` constants that are shared among classes in the *Logic component*.
* The *red arrow* shows that each command knows about the `Prefix` constants stored in `Prefixes`.

========
In future versions, `Prefixes` will be stored in the *Commands* package,
since each command will need to know all the `Prefix` that they are using.

This means that:

* The command parsers will obtain all the required `Prefix` from the respective command.
* The *green arrow* can be removed indicating that the command parsers no longer need information in `Prefixes`.
========

====

In addition to Figure 5., in Figure 6. you can see that:

. There is a *hierarchy* of parsers, starting from `TaTrackerParser`.
. Each group of parsers have been split into *smaller packages* (named as `X` in the diagram)
within the package of parsers.
. Each `Command` has a `Parser` that creates it from a user input.
. These `Command` classes are placed in *smaller packages* (with the same name `X`) within the package of commands.
. A `Command` produces a `CommandResult` when executed by `LogicManager`.
* This will modify the `Model` internally (e.g. adding a student).
. The resulting `CommandResult` encapsulates the feedback that needs to be passed to the `Ui`. +
This feedback includes:
* showing messages in the `UI`, and
* instructing the `Ui` to perform certain actions (e.g. displaying the help window).

====
[horizontal]
In most cases, there are two levels of parsing before a command is created +
(i.e. `XCommandParser` passes the parsing to `XYCommandParser`).

However there are some cases where only one level of parsing is needed +
(e.g. for the `help`, `report`, and `exit` commands).

.Skipping the second layer of parsers
image::LogicClassDiagram3.png[]

These command parsers will immediately create the respective `Command`,
skipping the second layer of parsers (indicated by the red arrow in Figure 6.).
====

==== Overview of Commands

All *commands* have been packaged under their respective categories.

.Structure of commands in different categories
image::CommandsPackageDiagram1.png[]

These packages depend on the `Command` class since they contain commands that inherit from the `Command` class (not shown above).

In addition, the following diagram shows the information that a command should have.

.Internal structure of all commands
image::CommandsPackageDiagram2.png[]

. In each package, all commands should have their own `CommandDetails`.
. `CommandDetails` store all the information that each command should have, +
(e.g. their `commandWord` and `usage` message).
. For their `commandWord` and `sub word`, commands may use constants in `CommandWords` to avoid repetition +
(e.g. "add", "delete", "edit").
. The `CommandDictionary`, stores a list of `CommandDetails` for all the commands.
. The `CommandDictionary` is used for:
* *syntax highlighting*, and
* listing information in the *help window*

==== Overview of Parsers

In a similar way, all *parsers* have been packaged under the same respective categories.

.Structure of parsers in different categories
image::ParserPackageDiagram1.png[]

These packages depend on the `Parser` interface since they contain command parsers that inherit from the `Parser` interface
(not shown above).

In addition, the following diagram shows the information that a command parser should have.

.Internal structure of all command parsers
image::ParserPackageDiagram2.png[]

. All command parsers use some `Prefix` constants defined in `Prefixes`.
. `PrefixDetails` adds more information to a `Prefix` +
(e.g. their `constraint` message and a list of `examples`).
. A `PrefixDetail` has a `Predicate` to validate the user input arguments.
. The `PrefixDictionary` stores two lists of `Prefix` objects:
** `parameters` - a list of command parameters, and
** `optionals` - a list of optional parameters for the same command.
. The `PrefixDictionary` stores a list of `PrefixDetails` for all the `Prefix` objects in `parameters` and `optionals`.
. The `PrefixDictionary` is used for:
* *syntax highlighting*, and
* listing information in the *help window*

====
The difference between the *commands* and *parsers* is that the *commands* store their own `CommandDetails`,
while the *parsers* do not store any `PrefixDetails`. Instead, they use a number of `Prefix` objects to
parse user inputs. This is because they do not need the extra information stored in `PrefixDetails`.

`PrefixDetails` adds more information to a `Prefix` instead of extending it.
Therefore, it can be detached from the command parsers without changing the `Prefix` constants in `Prefixes`.
====

==== Example Logic Sequence
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("group add m/CS2103 g/G03 t/lab")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `group add m/CS2103 g/G03 t/lab` Command
image::AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* The lifeline for `GroupCommandParser` and `AddGroupCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* Since the purpose of this diagram is to show the interactions within the `Logic` component,
irrelevant interactions with the `Model` component have been omitted.
====

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the TA-Tracker data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more `OOP` model, we can store a `Tag` list in `TaTracker`, which `Student` can
reference. This would allow `TaTracker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique
`Tag`, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of what
such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The following diagram is a simplified view of the Storage component.

.Simplified structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram1.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the TA-Tracker data in json format and read it back.

==== Saved Data
The following diagram is a breakdown of the data managed by the Storage component.

.Structure of the data stored by TA-Tracker
image::StorageClassDiagram2.png[]

`TA-Tracker` saves the following data:

* a list of `Module` objects representing the modules that the user is assisting. +
+
Within each module, there is:

** a list of `Session`, representing the `done sessions` that the user has completed for that module.
** a list of `Group`, representing the groups that the user is
in charge of, such as a tutorial or lab. +
+
Within each group, there is:

*** a list of `Student`, representing the students enrolled in
the respective groups.

* a separate list of `Session` objects representing the sessions that the user has scheduled in the future.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tatracker.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[StudentView]]
=== Student View
*Student View* is used to display all modules, groups and students in the TA-Tracker.

Students are a part of *groups* and groups are a part of *modules*.

==== Model Framework
The following class diagram shows how different classes are related in the
functioning of the `Student View`.

.Module View - Class Diagram
image::ModuleModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `TaTracker` class contains a `UniqueModuleList` which helps it keep track
of the different *modules* the user is associated with. Each `Module` contains a
`UniqueGroupList` and a `UniqueSessionList`.

The `UniqueGroupList` contains a list of all the *groups* of a module that the user
is affiliated with. Each `Group` contains a `UniqueStudentsList` that contains the
*students* in that group.

The `UniqueSessionList` contains a list of all the *sessions that have already been
done* associated with the module. This list is used in the TSS view.

====
*Alternative Implementation*

* An alternative implementation would be to have a single `UniqueModuleList` to store
all modules, a `List` to store all groups and a `List` to store all students.

* We would then have to filter by module code and/or group code to show the appropriate
groups and students.

* This would require students to keep track of which group and which module they're
a part of. Similarly, groups would have to keep a track of the students it contains.
This would create a cyclic dependency (which could be solved using an association class).

* The `List` of groups could contain multiple groups with the same group code as group code
is only unique within a module. Group codes can be shared across modules.

* While this implementation would make it easier to generate a report at the end of
the semester (explained towards the end of the guide), it would require more commands
and the creation of association classes which would unnecessarily complicate the model.
That is why we decided to stick to our current implementation.

====
==== Implementation of the Module Add, Delete and Edit Commands

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of commands that take place
between the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker when the user enters the
command `module add m/CS2103 n/Software Engineering`.

Note: This diagram assumes that there is no module with the module code `CS2103`
pre-existing in the TA-Tracker.

.Module Add - Sequence Diagram
image::AddModuleSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline for `ModuleCommandParser` and `AddModuleCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is of type *module* and passes the
command to the `ModuleCommandParser`.

3. The `ModuleCommandParser` sees that the command is of type *add* and passes the
arguments to the `AddModuleCommandParser`.

4. The `AddModuleCommandParser` creates a `Module` with the given module code and
name.

5. The `AddModuleCommandParser` then creates an `AddModuleCommand` object and passes
it the created module. The parser then returns the `AddModuleCommand` object.

6. LogicManager calls `AddModuleCommand` 's execute method. The `AddModuleCommand` object
checks whether a module with the given module code already exists in TA-Tracker.
If it does, a command exception is thrown saying that a module with the given module
code already exists in the TA-Tracker.

7. If no such module exists, the module is added to the TA-Tracker.

8. The `AddModuleCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The command used to delete a module has been implemented in a similar way. The main
difference is that the `DeleteModuleCommand` checks whether an object with the given
module code exists in the TA-Tracker. If no such module exists, a command exception
is thrown saying that a module with the given module code doesn't exist. If it does
exist, *first all the sessions linked to that module are removed* , then the module
is removed from the TA-Tracker.

The `module edit` command has been implemented in a similar manner.

==== Implementation of the Group Add, Delete and Edit Commands

A group is added to the TA-Tracker in a similar manner to to how a module is added to
the TA-Tracker.

The following steps are taken once the execute command of an AddGroupCommand object
is called:

. The `AddGroupCommand` object checks whether the *module* is present in the model of the TA-Tracker.
.. If it exists, the module is retrieved.
.. If it doesn't exist, an exception is thrown explaining that the module doesn't
exist.
. The `AddGroupCommand` object checks whether a *group* with the same group code as
the new group exists in the module retrieved beforehand.
.. If it doesn't exist, the group is added to the module and a `CommandResult` object
with the success message is returned.
.. If it does exist, an exception is thrown explaining that you can't have two groups
with the same group code in a module.

The interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components when adding a group are similar
to the interactions when deleting a group as shown below.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between the logic and model
components when the user inputs the command `group delete m/CS2103 g/G03`.

Note: This diagram is under the case where a group with the group code G03 does exist
in the module with module code CS2103 inside the TA-Tracker.

.Group Delete - Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline for `GroupCommandParser` and `DeleteGroupCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* The main difference between the `Module` and `Group` commands is that the `Group`
commands require extra checks to check whether a group with the given group code
exists inside the module with the given module code.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is of type *group* and passes the
command to the `GroupCommandParser`.

3. The `GroupCommandParser` sees that the command is of type *delete* and passes the
arguments to the `DeleteGroupCommandParser`.

4. The `DeleteGroupCommandParser` then creates a `DeleteGroupCommand` object and passes
it the module code, group code and group type. The parser then returns the `DeleteGroupCommand` object.

5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteGroupCommand` 's execute method. The `DeleteGroupCommand` object
checks whether a *module* with the given module code already exists in TA-Tracker.
If it doesn't, a command exception is thrown saying that a module with the given module
code doesn't exist in the TA-Tracker.

6. If the module exists, the `DeleteGroupCommand` then checks whether a group with the
given group code exists within that module. If it doesn't,
a command exception is thrown saying that no such group exists. If the group does
exist, it is removed from the module.

7. The `DeleteGroupCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The `group edit` command has been implemented in a similar manner.

==== Implementation of the Sort Command

The sort command allows the user to sort the students in the module view either *alphabetically*,
by *rating (in ascending or descending order)* or by *matriculation number*.

The sort command can be used in three ways:

1. `sort group g/GROUP_CODE m/MODULE_CODE t/TYPE` : When a user enters the command in this
manner, they are sorting all the students of the given group in the given module
by type TYPE.

2. `sort module g/MODULE_CODE t/TYPE` : When a user enters a command in this manner, they
are sorting all the students of all the groups in the given module by type TYPE
(which can be either alphabetical or by rating).

3. `sort all t/TYPE` : When a user enters a command in this manner, they are sorting all
students of all groups of all the modules in the TA-Tracker by the type TYPE (which
can be either alphabetical or by rating).

[NOTE]
====
* `TYPE` here could mean any of the following:
** `alpha`, `alphabetical` or `alphabetically` to sort alphabetically.
** `rating asc` to sort by rating in ascending order.
** `rating desc` to sort by rating in descending order.
** `matric` to sort by matriculation number.
====

Since these sort commands function differently but use the same parser, the following
class structure is used.

.Sort Commands - Class Diagram
image::SortCommandsClassDiagram.png[]

Since the different commands use the same parser, the `SortCommandParser` needs to check
which prefixes have been passed and return the appropriate command accordingly.
The following activity diagram shows the steps the SortCommandParser takes once
its parse command is called (assuming that no exception is thrown).

.SortCommandParser - Activity Diagram
image::SortParserActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* Typically, the alternative paths would emerge from a single diamond but due to
a limitation in PlantUML's beta version of showing activity diagrams, we were
unable to show it that way.

* The final else clause would throw an error explaining that the command format is
invalid. But due to a limitation in PlantUML's beta version of showing activity diagrams,
we were unable to indicate exceptions thrown in the proper way and decided to mention
it here instead.

* Command word here refers to `all`, `module` or `group`.

* If the user enters the `sort` command with a command word but doesn't include the
appropriate parameters with the correct prefixes, a command exception is thrown.
====

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the logic and
model components when the user enters the command `sort all t/matric`.

.Sort - Sequence Diagram
image::SortAllSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* The `SortCommandParser`, which creates `Sort` commands, is different from the other
command parsers. While the other commands have another level of parsing (such as the
`ModuleCommandParser` for `Module` commands), the SortCommandParser
creates all the different Sort commands within itself.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is of type `sort` and passes the
command to the `SortCommandParser`.

3. The SortCommandParser performs the steps shown in the previous activity diagram
and determines that the sort command word is `all` and creates and returns a
`SortCommand`.

4. `LogicManager` calls `SortCommand` 's execute method.

5. `SortCommand` checks the type of sorting that is indicated. Since the sort type
is `matric` , it calls `model` 's `sortModulesByMatricNumber()` command.

6. The `SortCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

==== Implementation of the Student Add and Delete Commands

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of commands that take place
between the logic and model components of the TA-Tracker when the user enters the
command 'student add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/A0181234G'.

Note: This diagram assumes that there is no student with the matric number 'A0181234G'
pre-existing in the TA-Tracker.

.Student Add - Sequence Diagram
image::AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline for `StudentCommandParser` and `AddStudentCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
====

1. LogicManager uses the TATrackerParser to first parse the user command.

2. The TATrackerParser sees that the command is of type student and passes the
command to the StudentCommandParser.

3. The StudentCommandParser sees that the command is of type add and passes the
arguments to the AddStudentCommandParser.

4. The AddStudentCommandParser creates a Student with the given parameters.

5. The AddStudentCommandParser then creates an AddStudentCommand object and passes
it the created module. The parser then returns the AddStudentCommand

6. LogicManager calls AddStudentCommand's execute method. The AddStudentCommand object
checks whether a student with the given matric number already exists in TA-Tracker.
If it does, a command exception is thrown saying that a student with the matric number
already exists in the TA-Tracker.

7. If no such student exists, the student is added to the TA-Tracker.

The command used to delete a student has been implemented in a similar way. The main
difference is that the DeleteStudentCommand checks whether an object with the given
matric number exists in the TA-Tracker. If no such student exists, a command exception
is thrown saying that a student with the given matric number doesn't exist. If it does
exist, the student is removed from the TA-Tracker.

Note: This diagram assumes that there exists a student with the matric number 'A0181234G'
pre-existing in the TA-Tracker.

.Student Delete - Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. LogicManager uses the TATrackerParser to first parse the user command.

2. The TATrackerParser sees that the command is of type student and passes the
command to the StudentCommandParser.

3. The StudentCommandParser sees that the command is of type delete and passes the
arguments to the DeleteStudentCommandParser.

4. The DeleteStudentCommandParser creates a Student with the given matric number

5. The DeleteStudentCommandParser then creates a DeleteStudentCommand object and passes
it the created student. The parser then returns the DeleteStudentCommand

6. LogicManager calls DeleteStudentCommand's execute method. The DeleteGroupCommand object
checks whether a student with the given matric number already exists in TA-Tracker.
If it doesn't, a command exception is thrown saying that a student with the given matric number
doesn't exist in the TA-Tracker.

7. If the student exists, the DeleteStudentCommand object retrieves the student from the
model and removes the student.

//tag::tssview[]
=== TSS View
TSS view is the term used to characterise the different functionalities
related to the done sessions that the user is affiliated with.

==== Model Framework
The following class diagram shows how different classes are related in the
functioning of the TSS view.

.TSS View - Class Diagram
image::TssModelClassDiagram.png[]

The TaTracker model class contains a TSS which helps it keep track of the total
hours the user is associated with. Each TSS contains the TotalHours of all the
done sessions, a rate which represents how much the user is paid per hour and
the total earnings of the user.

.TSS View - Activity Diagram
image::TssActivityDiagram.png[]

1. A DoneSessionCommand is called,
2. TotalHours is incremented according to the duration of the completed session.
3. The duration of the completed session is calculated by subtracting StartDateTime
of the session from EndDateTime and then rounding up the value to a whole.
4. TotalEarnings is calculated by multiplying TotalHours with Rate

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::syntaxhighlighting[]
=== Syntax Highlighting
When a user types a command into the `CommandBox`, their inputs will be highlighted in different colours
as a form of input validation.

In addition, the `ResultBox` will display different messages based on the result of the syntax highlighting.

==== Overview
The following diagram shows how the Logic and UI components interact with each other to produce the highlighting.

.Syntax Highlighting - Class Diagram
image::SyntaxHighlightingClassDiagram.png[]

* The `CommandBox` uses a `CommandDictionary` to search for valid commands.
* The `CommandBox` stores a `CommandDetail` for processing the current command in the user input.
* The `CommandBox` stores a `PrefixDictionary` containing the required argument details (`PrefixDetails`) for the current command.
* The `CommandBox` uses a `CommandBoxUtil` to scan for valid user inputs.
* The `CommandBox` returns feedback to the `ResultDisplay`.
* The `ResultDisplay` displays the given feedback tas a message in the program.

==== Implementation
The following diagrams show the steps for the different types of highlighting.

Here are some keywords that will be used to explain the implementation:

* A `full command word` is a text that identifies a command.

* An `argument` is a text that contains a `prefix` and a `value`.

** The `prefix` is the text value of a `Prefix` in the Logic component.
** The `value` is all the text following the `prefix`.

* The `preamble` is the text (including whitespaces) between the end of the
`full command word`, and the beginning of the first `argument`.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the limitations of PlantUML, some of the diagrams may not appear as expected.

In particular, there are issues with representing alternate paths in PlantUML BETA Activity Diagrams

For example:

. They split into multiple diamonds, instead of all originating from the same diamond.
. They do not converge at a single diamond, and instead skips it altogether.
. They cannot join other branches.

In particular, the biggest limitation was the third issue.
To overcome this, you will see multiple end nodes in some of the diagrams.
Please assume that they all converge into a single diamond before reaching the end node.

====

===== Step 1. Highlighting a new input
When a new input is entered in the `CommandBox`,
the syntax highlighting will be reapplied to the entire input.

The following activity diagram explains how the `full command word` is highlighted,
up until the beginning of the `preamble`.

.Step 1 - Highlighting a new input
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram1.png[]

Here is the purpose of each partition in the above diagram:

* `blank` +
When there is no input,
the `ResultBox` should not show anything.

* `invalid` +
When there is no matching `full command word`,
the `ResultBox` should indicate that a wrong command is entered.

* `valid` +
When there is a matching `full command word`,
change the highlighting rules for the new command.

* `no_arguments` +
When `full command word` has just been entered,
the `ResultBox` should indicate that a correct command has been entered.

* `has_arguments` +
After processing the `full command word`,
proceed to step 2. +
+
NOTE: There should be a rake symbol next to the only activity in this partition.

===== Step 2. Highlighting the preamble
After verifying that the new input has a `full command word`,
the highlighting will also need to be reapplied to the `preamble` and `arguments`.

The following activity diagram explains how the `preamble` is highlighted,
up until the beginning of the first `argument`.

.Step 2 - Highlighting the preamble
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram2.png[]

Here is the purpose of each partition in the above diagram:

* `whitespaces` +
Inputs that have trailing whitespaces will be handled separately.

* `many_whitespaces` +
When there are more than two trailing whitespaces,
the `ResultBox` should reshow how to use the command.

* `preamble_error` +
When the input has a `preamble` that the command does not need,
the `ResultBox` should indicate that a wrong command is entered.

* `preamble_end` +
After processing the `preamble`,
proceed to step 3. +
+
NOTE: There should be a rake symbol next to the only activity in this partition.

===== Step 3. Highlighting the remaining arguments
After verifying that the `preamble` is valid for the given `full command word`,
the highlighting will need to be reapplied to each `argument` in the remaining user input.

The following activity diagram explains how each `argument` is highlighted,
up until end of the user input.

.Step 3 - Highlighting the remaining arguments
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram3.png[]

Here is the purpose of each partition in the above diagram:

* `wrong` +
When the command does not need the given `argument`,
the `ResultBox` should reshow how to use the command.

* `invalid` +
When the `argument` cannot have the given `value`,
the `ResultBox` should show how to use the `argument`.

* `valid` +
After processing the current `argument`,
the `ResultBox` will still show how to use the argument in case the `argument`
can have spaces.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect #1: Executing the syntax highlighting in real-time
The current implementation reapplies the highlighting whenever the user input changes.
When no input is changed, the program will idle.

In contrast, having an infinite loop can achieve the same highlighting,
but the program cannot idle and will consume memory when in use.

===== Aspect #2: Range of syntax highlighting
The current implementation uses three colours for the syntax highlighting.

The following colours are used:

* `Red` - invalid input
* `Green` - valid input
* `White` - the default font colour for the `CommandBox` input

These colours have been chosen because they are standard signalling colours used in
everyday life. Therefore the user will be familiar with these colour signals without
a need for an explanation.

Valid inputs have been highlighted in order to signal to the user that they have used
the command correctly. An alternative would be to remove this colour though, as having too
many flashing colours may be distracting to the user.
// end::syntaxhighlighting[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[[Implementation-Find]]
=== Filter Command

Find Command should be used under the current view. Find Command returns specified search that contains any of the given keywords.
The search functionality is crucial to the user's experience with TaTracker.

This section will describe in detail the implementation of the find command.

The activity diagram below summarises what happens when a user executes the find command :

image::FindCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

Figure 1 Activity Diagram for the Execution of Find Command

==== Implementation

Find Feature consists of three main parts:

1. validate and parse user input

2. create a filtering predicate from user's specified keywords

3. update the filtered list with the filtering predicate

The find feature is facilitated by the following classes:

    * `FindCommandParser`

It validates and parses user input to an instance of FindCommand.


    * `FindKeywordDescriptor`

It stores keywords specified by the user.
