The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the
functioning of the *Student View*.

.Student View - Class Diagram

In the diagram above, you can see that:

* The `TaTracker` class contains a `UniqueModuleList` which helps it keep track
of the different *modules* the user is teaching.

* Each `Module` contains a `UniqueGroupList`.

* Each `UniqueGroupList` contains a list of all the *groups of a module* that the user
is teaching.

* Each `Group` contains a `UniqueStudentsList` that contains the *students in that group*.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions
between the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the
command `module add m/CS2103 n/Software Engineering`.

[NOTE]
====
* This diagram assumes that a module with the module code `CS2103`
doesn't exist in the TA-Tracker.

* The lifeline for `ModuleCommandParser` and `AddModuleCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that this command is a *module command* and passes the
command to the `ModuleCommandParser`.

3. The `ModuleCommandParser` sees that this command is an *add command* and passes the
arguments to the `AddModuleCommandParser`.

4. The `AddModuleCommandParser` creates a `Module` with the given module code and
name.

5. The `AddModuleCommandParser` then creates an `AddModuleCommand` object with a newly
created module. The parser then returns the `AddModuleCommand` object.

6. `LogicManager` calls `AddModuleCommand#execute()`.

7. The `AddModuleCommand` object
checks whether a module with the given module code already exists in *TA-Tracker*

.. If it does, a *command exception is thrown* saying that a module with the given module
code already exists in the *TA-Tracker*.

.. If no such module exists, the *module is added to the TA-Tracker*.

8. The `AddModuleCommand` returns a `CommandResult`.

Since the `Sort` commands function differently but use a single parser,
the structure shown in the following
_Class Diagram_ is used.

.Sort Commands - Class Diagram
image::SortCommandsClassDiagram.png[,400]

[NOTE]
====
* `SortGroupCommand` sorts the students in a particular group of a
particular module.
* `SortModuleCommand` sorts the students in all groups of all modules.
* `SortCommand` sorts the students in all groups of all modules.
====
Since the different commands use the same parser,
the `SortCommandParser` needs to check the sub-command word and return
the appropriate sort command.

The following _Activity Diagram_ shows the steps the `SortCommandParser` takes once
its _parse_ method is called (assuming that no exception is thrown).

.SortCommandParser - Activity Diagram

[NOTE]
====
* The sub-command word here refers to `all`, `module` or `group`. If none of the above
command words are used, a *command exception* will be thrown, explaining that it is an
invalid comnmand.

* If the user enters the `sort` command with a command word but *doesn't include the
appropriate parameters with the correct prefixes, a command exception is thrown*.
====

The following _Sequence Diagram_ illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and
`Model` components when the user enters the command `sort all t/matric`.

.Sort - Sequence Diagram

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* The `SortCommandParser`, which creates `Sort` commands, is different from the other
command parsers. While the other commands have another level of parsing (such as the
`ModuleCommandParser` for `Module` commands), the `SortCommandParser`
creates all the different Sort commands within itself.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a *sort command* and passes the
command to the `SortCommandParser`.

3. The `SortCommandParser` performs the steps shown in the previous activity diagram
and determines that since the sub-command word is `all` , it must create and return a
`SortCommand`.

4. `LogicManager` calls `SortCommand#execute()`.

5. `SortCommand` checks the type of sorting that is indicated. Since the sort type
is `matric` , it calls `Model#sortModulesByMatricNumber()` command.

6. The `SortCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.
