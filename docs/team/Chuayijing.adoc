=== PROJECT: TA-Tracker

=== OverView

This portfolio seeks to document my contributions to our team's project, TA-Tracker.
Ta-Tracker is a productivity tool designed for NUS School of Computing
Teaching Assistants (TAs).
TAs cam track and manage all their claimable hours and the students
they are teaching under one place.

=== About this portfolio
This project portfolio details my individual contributions to the TA-Tracker project.
It includes a summary of the enhancements and other contributions I made throughout
the duration of the project. Additionally, portions of my contribution to the User Guide
and Developer Guide have also been included.

=== Summary of contributions

The contributions I have made towards the team project are detailed in this section.

==== Major Enhancement: I added the ability to filter under each view.

* *What it does*: The `filter` command allows the user to search for relevant information
under the different views.
** Under the Student View, there is `FilterStudentCommand` to filter the students.
** Under the Session View, there is `FilterSessionCommand` to filter the sessions.
** Under the Claims View, there is `FilterClaimCommand` to filter the claims.

* *Justification*: This is a necessary feature for a system that intends to manage
a lot of data. Sometimes, users only need to view a specific information, and
that is when the `filter` command is handy.

* *Highlights*: This enhancement affects existing commands and has to support future commands.
Since the filtering works differently under the different views,
the implementation of each filter command is different also. The implementation was
challenging as it required a lot of changes to the existing find command in AB3.
Furthermore, there is a need to ensure that certain restrictions are met
before doing the filtering. This is so that our codebase is consistent.

===== Major Enhancement: Recurring Sessions.

* *What it does*: TAs are allowed to state that a session is recurring.
When the TA mark a session as done, a new session with the updated date
will be added into the list of sessions.

* *Justification*: This feature improves the product as TA's often have
classes to teach weekly. This feature makes TA-Tracker more user-friendly as
TA does not have to key in the same detail for a session every week manually.

* *Highlights*: This feature was difficult to implement as there were considerations to be
taken care of. Furthermore, it had been implemented in a different way. We initially
assumed that recurring lessons would be on a weekly basis. However, we realised that we
should not make that assumption. Significant changes were made in order for TAs to indicate
the number of recurring weeks that they want.

===== Other Minor Enhancements : Session related commands.

* *Justifications*: `AddSessionCommand`, `DeleteSessionCommand` and `list` commands
are essential for TAs to manipulate data in Session View.

* *Highlights*: While they are minor enhancements, implementation of these commands have
to be thorough. This is because there are many small details to take note of.
One example is the sorting of sessions when TA adds a session.
Sessions shown to TA have to be sorted based on date, start and end timing of sessions.

=== Other Contributions:

* Enhancements to existing features:

**  I wrote additional tests for existing features to increase
coverage from % to %
(Pull request: https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/343[#343])

** I fixed bugs reported by test users of the application.

=== Contributions to the User Guide
We wrote a User Guide targeted at the users of TA-Tracker.
The User Guide contains instructions on how to use the various commands
of the application. The following is an excerpt from our TA-Tracker User Guide,
showing additions that I have made for `filter` and `Session` features.

=== Contributions to the Developer Guide

In addition to a User Guide, we wrote a Developer Guide
targeted at developers who are interested in contributing to the project.
The Developer Guide showcases my ability to write technical documentation
and the technical depth of my contributions to the project.
Given below is my contribution to the Developer Guide:
