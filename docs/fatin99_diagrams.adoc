The following _Object Diagram_ shows an example of the relationship between the different `Model` objects.
This example is based on the state of TA-Tracker when it is first run (without any user data).

As a more `OOP` model, we can store a `Tag` list in `TaTracker`, which `Student` can
reference. This would allow `TaTracker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique
`Tag`, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of what
such a model may look like is given below. +
